Travel-NLP
##########

This project is a prototype for a travel portal.
The idea is to find a start, target and time information
in a given sentence of the german language. The project 
is also part of the course Human-Computer Interaction 
which is part of my study. 

I use named entity recognition which is supported by the
Apache OpenNLP library to make all this possible. 

This project contains also a small REST service 
which is implemented with the PlayMini framework.

Quickstart:

You need SBT 0.11.3.
